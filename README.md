# nicanor-tweets-data
Analyzing tweets data

## Setup Requirements

To run the setup script on a unix environment you will need:

* Python 3 (this was developed with version 3.11.5)
* Unzip command

## Installation

Run the setup.sh script to set up the environment:

`./setup.sh`

It will create a Python virtual environment, install the required libraries, decompress the full data and give permissions to execute the start script.



## Running the notebook

To activate the virtual environment and launch Jupyter Notebook run the start script:

`./start-jupyter.sh`

On Jupyter then open the tweets-data-local.ipynb notebook and run all cells.
